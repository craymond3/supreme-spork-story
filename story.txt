It was a cold, snowy morning in the northwoods. Temperatures were in the negative teens,
not including windchill. Young Tommy Winstead was bundled up tightly in his bed, not yet 
awake to perform his usual snowday routine of drinking hot chocolate in front of the fire.
But what he did not know was that this would not turn out to be just a normal snowday.

As Tommy slowly awoke, he started his routine. He donned his wooly socks, his
slippers, and a large, red hat to cover his large, red hair. He descended the
stairs from his room, but to his surprise, he found that his entire house was
filled with snow!

"Oh no" Tommy yelled! He hated shoveling, but now it became a necessity, as his favorite
breakfast (hot chocolate) could not be reached as it had been covered in snow. 
He trudged his way to the garagae to grab the shovel and begin shoveling.
